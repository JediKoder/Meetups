Welcome to Circuit Python

CircuitPython is a programming language designed to simplify experimentation and education on low-cost microcontrollers. It's super
simple to get started with and great for learning. It doesn't matter if you're a seasoned programmer or you've never written a line
of code in your life; get a board, find a USB cable, choose a text editor, and you're ready to begin. That's all it takes! 
"Welcome to CircuitPython" will be your introduction to this amazing language and some of the great things you can do with it. 
We'll move from using an onboard LED to do blinky - the CircuitPython "Hello, world!", to demonstrating how to interact with 
sensors, and finally a few surprises at the end!
